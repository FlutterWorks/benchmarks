A repository to benchmark Flutter libs.
Creators of the tested libs can suggest improvements, as long as they follow the same design structure.

The idle application consumes 4.0mb of ram.
Items were added dynamically to a ListView, and after the test was completed, a screenshot was taken. The garbage collector was triggered manually, and another screenshot was taken.
The added RAM added to the idle application was measured.


A more robust benchmark is being made and the typo in Banners will be replaced.
